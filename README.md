# MCJUG-Demo-Angular2-Typscript
repo for mcjug demonstration 

Goal: 

interactively building a water down prototype with Typescript and Angular 2 angular cli (scaffold) start/unit test-karma/e2e-protractor to prod build. 

ex. comparable to youtube angular 2 videos except with questions from jug. with just a a few bulleted slides. 

set up like one of those kitchen shows (where the steps are pre assembled) to keep it going smooth and keep down typing on keyboard. In my mind will be to some degree a jug extension/sequel of the john papa demo from last the spring, where I got a hold of some ideas to start.
